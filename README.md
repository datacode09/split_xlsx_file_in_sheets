## To execute this script:

# Save it to a .ps1 file (e.g., Split-XLSX.ps1).
# Open PowerShell and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
# Run the script using the following command: PowerShell.exe -File "C:\Path\To\Split-XLSX.ps1"

# Replace "C:\Path\To\Split-XLSX.ps1" with the actual path to your saved script and adjust the $filepath variable accordingly.
# This script will create separate files for each sheet in your original XLSX file. You can modify the output format (e.g., CSV) by changing the $output_type variable1
